# Developing Locally

1. Rename `.env.example` to `.env`. You will need API keys:

- From a X(Twitter) developer account, https://developer.twitter.com.

- From your access token key from your Mastodon instance. This is found in `Preferences > Development`. You will need to create a new application if you dont have one already

2. You can then run the npm script starting with `dev:` to test posting whilst in local development
